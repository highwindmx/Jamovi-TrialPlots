# Jamovi-TrialPlots
 A jamovi module to generate visualizations for clinical trials.
让临床数据说话，从一张好图开始。

## 🌟 Why Jamovi-TrialPlots?

Do you want to create publication-ready clinical trial plots but don’t know R?  
Are you tired of wrestling with code just to generate a waterfall plot or swimmer diagram?

**Jamovi-TrialPlots is here to help.**

This module brings professional-grade clinical trial visualizations directly into [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org)—a free, open-source, and user-friendly statistical platform. With **zero coding required**, you can produce clear, customizable, and journal-ready graphics through an intuitive point-and-click interface.

## 📊 Features

Jamovi-TrialPlots currently includes five essential analyses for clinical trial reporting:

## Analysis 1 Waterfall Plot
Visualize individual subject-level changes (e.g., tumor shrinkage) from baseline to endpoint—commonly used in oncology trials.

## Analysis 2 Spider Plot
Display longitudinal trajectories for each participant over time, showing how responses evolve during treatment.

## Analysis 3 Swimmer Plot
Illustrate treatment duration, key events (e.g., disease progression, dropout), and study arms on a timeline—ideal for summarizing complex trial timelines.

## Analysis 4 Group Sequential Sample Size Estimation
Supports planning of group sequential designs by estimating required sample sizes under various stopping rules and interim analysis scenarios.
